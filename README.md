This repository is made for those who are looking for an older meteor client version but don't want to search for a long time for the version they want.

I will not accept .jar files from other users because of security concerns, this means that some versions below 1.21 are not avaliable (while I am still adding to this repo). If you make an issue for a specific version I might be able to build it and put it here.

As is said on meteor client's [old version page](https://meteorclient.com/faq/old-versions), it says that don't trust archived versions of meteor. You make the decicion to use these files at your own risk.\
I do still recommend to use the other method by using ViaFabricPlus ([link](https://meteorclient.com/faq/old-versions#using-viafabricplus)). It supports basically all versions from 1.0.0 up to the lastest (read the mod page for the specific latest supported version).

For versions older than 1.21.3, if the jar file is named by 'meteor-client-{**minecraft** version}.jar' then it has been compiled by me from the repository. All others are older versions of meteor I just happened to have on my computer. 1.21.4 onwards should all be downloaded then uploaded from the website however if a version has been missed and it is needed for some reason then it will be marked with -compiled in the name.\
If a .jar ends with a 4 digit number or a # followed by a number it is probably a development version. It would probably still work it just may have a few bugs which the stable file (for its version) doesn't.\
I will also only support the builds/versions are they are shown in the #builds channel in meteor client's discord.

Following meteors licencing rules:\
All of the compiled code here is from https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client I have not added or removed anything.
