This repository is made for those who are looking for an older meteor client version but don't want to search for a long time for the version they want.

I will not accept .jar files from other users because of security concerns, this means that most versions below 1.21 are not avaliable. If you make an issue for a specific version I might be able to build it and put it here.

As is said on meteor client's [old version page](https://meteorclient.com/faq/old-versions), it says that don't trust archived versions of meteor. You make the decicion to use these files at your own risk.\
I do still recommend to use the other method by using ViaFabricPlus ([link](https://meteorclient.com/faq/old-versions#using-viafabricplus)). It supports basically all versions from 1.0.0 up to the lastest (read the mod page for the specific latest supported version).

If a .jar ends with a 4 digit number it is probably a development version. It would still work it just may have a few bugs which the stable version doesn't.\
I will also only support the builds/versions are they are shown in the #builds channel in meteor client's discord.

Following meteors licencing rules:\
All of the compiled code here is from https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client I have not added or removed anything.
